<p><b><font face="Arial">The Monkey Problem</font></b><br />
 
Five sailors are shipwrecked on an island. Fearing a long stay before rescue,
they gather together a large pile of coconuts as a source of nourishment. 
Night falls before they are able to divide the coconuts among themselves.
So, the sailors agree to go to sleep and divide the pile of coconuts in the 
morning. During the night, one of the sailors wakes up and decides to make 
sure that he gets his fair share of coconuts. He divides the pile into five 
equal piles, one for each sailor, with one coconut left over. He hides his 
pile, pushes the other four piles together and tosses the extra coconut to a
monkey that is watching him. A little while later, a second sailor wakes up 
and does the same dividing and hiding. He ends up with two extra coconuts, 
which he tosses to the monkey. As the night goes by, the other sailors wake 
up in turn to divide the pile of coconuts and hide their shares, each time 
giving any extra coconuts to the monkey. The third sailor has three coconuts 
left over, the fourth sailor has four coconuts left over but the fifth sailor 
has no coconuts left over. This works out well, since by the time the fifth 
sailor awakens to divide the pile, it is fairly late and the monkey has gone 
to bed. In the light of day, the pile of coconuts is much smaller, but no one 
points this out since each thinks he is responsible. The sailors do one last 
official division in which each sailor receives the same number of coconuts 
with one coconut left over. The sailors agree to give the extra coconut to 
the monkey for breakfast. Each sailor then takes his official pile and 
settles in to wait for rescue.
