Day of Week
This program will accept a date in the format mm/dd/yyyy (Ex. 12/12/1984
would be December 12, 1984) and will determine the day of the week on 
that given day.

Input
What is the date?
_month_/_day_/_year_

Calculations

To separate _year_ into _century_ and _non_century_:

century = year // 100
non_century = year % 100

1)  result = non_century // 12 

2)  remainder = non_century % 12
    result = result + remainder

3)  result = result + (remainder // 4)

4)  result = result % 7 (cast out 7s)

5)  month_adjustment is 0 if it is april or july
    month_adjustment is 1 if it is january or october
    month_adjustment is 2 if it is may
    month_adjustment is 3 if it is august
    month_adjustment is 4 if it is february, march, or november
    month_adjustment is 5 if it is june
    month_adjustment is 6 if it is september or december
    result = result + month_adjustment

6)  result = (result % 7) + day

7)  century_adjustment is 0 if it is the 20th century
    century_adjustment is 2 if it is the 19th century
    century_adjustment is 4 if it is the 18th or 22nd century
    century_adjustment is 6 if it is the 21st century
    result = (result % 7) + century_adjustment

8)  if the month is January or February 
    AND
    it is a leap year
    leap_year_adjustment = 1
        it is a leap year if the non_century year is evenly divisible by
        4. if the non_century year is 00, the century year must be 
        evenly divisible by 4 aswell
    otherwise, leap_year_adjustment = 0
    result = result - leap_year_adjustment
    
9)  if result is less than 0,
    result = result + 7

10) result = result % 7 (cast out 7s)

If the result is 0 the day is Saturday
If the result is 1 the day is Sunday
If the result is 2 the day is Monday
If the result is 3 the day is Tuesday
If the result is 4 the day is Wednesday
If the result is 5 the day is Thursday
If the result is 6 the day is Friday

Output

"The day of the week on _month_/_day_/_year_ is _result_."
